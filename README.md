# Wine Quality Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on various features.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine using Python and several key libraries.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `RandomForestClassifier`
- `train_test_split`
- `accuracy_score`

## Dataset

- **Source:** https://github.com/ayankins/Wine-Quality-Prediction/blob/main/winequality-red.csv
- **Description:** The dataset includes various attributes such as acidity levels, pH, alcohol content, etc., to predict wine quality.
